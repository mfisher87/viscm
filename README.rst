viscm
=====

This is a little tool for analyzing colormaps and creating new colormaps.

Try::

  $ pip install viscm
  $ python -m viscm view jet
  $ python -m viscm edit

There is some information available about how to interpret the
resulting visualizations and use the editor tool `on this website

Reproducing viridis
-------------------

Load [viridis AKA option_d.py](https://github.com/BIDS/colormap/) using:

```
python -m viscm --uniform-space buggy-CAM02-UCS -m Bezier edit /tmp/option_d.py
```

Note that there was a small bug in the assumed sRGB viewing conditions
while designing viridis. It does not affect the outcome by much. Also
see `python -m viscm --help`.
